from "fucker", plus docker

i use these to build shitty software that requires ubuntu or is generally unmaintainable trash.

This isn't exactly intented to be used by other people, but its not difficult to read the code either.



using:

```
$ cd anyproject

$ ./configure
error: ./configure detected you're not using ubuntu 14.04. that confuses our tiny brains!

$ fock ./configure
everything is well. praised be our lord ubuntu!
```
